For immediate release, Jan. 11, 2012: The Legalize2012.com Campaign has released draft language for its ballot initiative that is being proposed for the November 2012 ballot. You can read it online:

http://www.legalize2012.com/

The Legalize2012.com Initiative removes all criminal penalties for cannabis use in Colorado and sets up an independent commission to implement the law. This is a true citizenâ€™s ballot initiative, so all comments are welcome and will be incorporated as they can to further the goals of the amendment. Public Comments Requested: The ballot initiative will be open for public comments until Monday, Jan. 16, 2012.

Give your feedback by email: info@legalize2012.com Or participate in a public forum to discuss the amendment:

Know Your Ballot Initiatives: Legalize2012.com is NOT Initiative 30, which is supported by a different group. The Legalize2012.com amendment removes all criminal penalties and gives control of cannabis to the people. I30 gives more control to the police. Read more about the two campaigns on our website. Be prepared to educate yourself and other voters who may be confused by the two campaigns. Click here for a comparison of the two campaigns:

Timeframe: This ballot initiative will be filed with the Secretary of State and have more hearings on the language of it until it is finalized and a ballot title is set. That process should take 2 to 4 weeks. Then the ballot initiative can be printed and circulated for signatures, if sufficient funds are raised.
