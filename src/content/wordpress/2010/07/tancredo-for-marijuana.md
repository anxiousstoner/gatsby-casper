Colorado now has a bold new ganja warrior running for Governor who will put the current clowns in their place when it comes to marijuana. Tommy Tancredo calls marijuana “a social experiment that must happen”, according to [Denver Daily News](http://www.thedenverdailynews.com/article.php?aID=9426). Making it official yesterday, “I am going to seek the nomination of the American Constitution Party for governor of Colorado,” declared Tancredo in a one-sentence press release. His biggest opponent is that he is a write in third party candidate but says he will divide voters on the Republican ticket and come between candidates Maes and McInnis giving the Colorado marijuana community a good choice for Governor. [Tom is tuff](http://www.coloradostatesman.com/content/992007-tancredo-%3Fi%3Fm-no-longer-a-republican%3F) in his approach, and is quick to point the finger at Mayor Hickenlooper for letting the Denver town council step all over and shit on marijuana patients with new regulations of the industry.

It is good to see that on the eave of the law enforcement and the department of revenue seizing control of marijuana with their rubber law CO HB 10 1284, that there is a Constitutionally minded candidate running for governor of Colorado. The very people, the law makers and enforcers that should be defending our constitutional rights are trying to take them away, but Tancredo is in on the scene at the right time, and will defend the ganja consumers right to grow, use, and distribute medical marijuana. You are a ganja warrior Tom Tancredo for getting to the heart of the problem, and giving the people of Colorado back their constitutional right to obtain cannabis. Dispensaries are a social experiment in Colorado and they are certainly protected, legal, and here to stay. You have the High Country Caregiver vote of approval. With your help, pot will always stay fun in Colorado. See photos of medical marijuana and tell your friends about [smoke.io](https://smoke.io).

This bud is for you Tom Tancredo, we hope you will motivate others to stand up for their right to grow some cannabis today. Tom Tancredo 420 Colorado Governor of Choice!
