CBD cream made from cannabis is a great therapeutic ointment and moisturizer. There is a lot of scientific data and medical research available that shows its importance to humanity. Studies revealed that cannabinoids have important analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties that can help to relieve various types of ailments, pains, and skin diseases.

Unless you’re a medical marijuana patient who is prescribed medicinal marijuana for pain, finding a cream that is made with cannabinoids can be very difficult. Buying CBD cream in a dispensary can be very expensive, and often times the concentration amounts per gram is very low. Making your own CBD cream at home is the cheaper alternative with a better quality product in the end.

# Benefits of CBD Cream

There are two main benefits of cannabinoids in cream form. CBD cream is a great skincare product and pain reliever. It shows a lot of promise for those who are suffering from joint and muscle pain as well as skin disorders. There is still more medical research and scientific studies that need to be administered in order to determine if CBD creams are more beneficial than other topical pain relievers; however, there are a lot of individuals who are attracted to the idea of making CBD cream at home because it’s all natural and free of side effects. Some medicinal benefits include:

- Psoriasis: CBN, CBD, D9, and THCA all have the keratinocyte hyper-proliferation properties that in part are responsible for this inflammatory disease.

- Antibacterial: Cannabis contains cannabinoid acids CBD, D9-THC, CGB, CBC, and CBN that are important antibiotic and anti-fungal properties.

- Anti-Inflammatory: Research shows that CBD and THC both contain anti-inflammatory properties that are effective for treating some skin diseases.

## Making CBD Cream at Home

There are a lot of different ways to make CBD cream at home; however, this is one of the best recipes that are not only economical but simple to make. It’s also recommended to use a high-quality strain of cannabis for the best results.

### Ingredients:

- 10 grams of high-quality cannabis
- 30 grams of beeswax
- 1 cup of virgin coconut oil (unrefined)
- Essential oil like lavender or other oils with aromatic properties that suits your fragrance

### Preparation Wares:

- Fine Strainer or cheesecloth
- Spatula• Jar• Baking dish• Saucepan

## Directions:

Before you get started, you need to decarboxylate the cannabis. Decarboxylation is the chemical process that takes THCA, which is a non-psychoactive acid form of THCandconverts it into the highly therapeutic compound known as Delta9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC in medical cannabis is most commonly known for its pain-relieving effects.

The same process is required to get the maximum bioavailability found in other cannabinoids like CBD. Just like THC, it can be found in its acid form. Raw cannabis that is not decarboxylated is known as CBDA; however, raw cannabis has a lot of non-psychoactive benefits. These cannabinoid acids are effective anti-inflammatories. Additionally, raw cannabis is loaded with nutrients and vitamins just like raw vegetables are.

### Step 1

To decarboxylate your cannabis, set the oven temperature to about 225 degrees Fahrenheit. Spread your cannabis evenly on a baking dish. Let the cannabis warm for about 10-15 minutes. Stir it once or twice for an even toasting. Decarbed cannabis will look darker in color without being burnt. This process will work for kief, trim, stems, and buds.

### Step 2

While your cannabis is in the oven, use a saucepan and heat the virgin coconut oil to about 310 degrees Fahrenheit. The maximum temperature for the terpenes in the herbs fragrant is between 310-400 degrees Fahrenheit. If the temperature exceeds this heat index, terpenes can be burnt off which affects the flavor/aroma and lessens medical effects.

### Step 3

Once the cannabis is decarboxylated, remove it from the oven and add it to the saucepan with the coconut oil. Using a spatula, stir well and cook on low heat for about 20 minutes. Then remove it from the heat, and strain the mixture with a fine strainer or cheesecloth. This will keep the stems of the cannabis from getting into your cream.

### Step 4

Pour the strained mixture back into the saucepan and add one part of beeswax per five parts of cannabis oil. Using the spatula, mix it all together over low heat.

### Step 5

Remove the mixture from heat, add the essential oil, and mix well.

### Step 6

Pour the finished product into a glass jar, let cool and cover.

Once your finished product is cooled off, it’s immediately ready for use, and keep the cover on it to keep it fresh when it’s not in use. Congratulations, the CBD cream you just made at home was not only easy, but it’s also a high-quality medicinal product that saved you money.
